# telnetEmulator
Created this python script to emulate a telnet server and log an input username, password and commands that are entered. 
This script is probably not secure...

After executing this python program it will begin to listen on port 23.  Any username, password, or command that is entered
will appear in a log file called "outputInfo.txt".  You can then parse outputInfo.txt to find the IP, username, password and 
commands executed.
